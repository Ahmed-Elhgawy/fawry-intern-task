# Custom Command (mygrep.sh)
mygrep.sh is a bash script used to mimic a mini version of the grep command. \
Its basic functionality is searching for a string (case-insensitive) in a single file and print the matching line in this file

### Command Options
`-n` - - > Show line numbers for each match \
`-v` - - > Invert the match (print lines that do not match)

## How the script handles arguments and options.
